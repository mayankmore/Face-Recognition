# Face Recognition  

This is a real time face recognition project which captures images from webcam video stream. Faces from the image frame is extracted using Haarcascades. And it is stored in numpy arrays to generate training data.

KNN(K-Nearest Neighbours) has been used here to find the predictions of the face. Algorithm detects face and display the predictions on screen with bounding box on face and name.
